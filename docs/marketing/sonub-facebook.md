- The sonub is a social group for people in the world.
  - It's a replacement of facebook. Or its competitive service is the facebook, instragram, twitter, tiktok, youtube, etc.
  - Sonub dear challenges to a big social service like facebook.

- The difference from other social services is "No AI".
  - We only deal with various materials generated by humans and pure human stories unaffected by AI influence.
    - During registration, users must prove they are human. Content generated by AI will face sanctions. We only cover pure human stories without AI interference or influence.
  - Activities with commercial purposes such as influencers, advertising, promotion, marketing, sponsorship, partnerships, support, and collaboration are prohibited.
    - Commercial activities will face sanctions to maintain a space exclusively for people.

# Strategy

- Keep the facebook group in good shape and reputation.
- Don't allow or update junk posts generated by AI.
  - Use AI for a source but must add your own human touch.
  - Facebook system will lower the ranking of AI-generated posts. And the sonub group will loose its reputation and ranking.
    - It will result in less people seeing the posts.
    - This will lead no results when people search "social group in Manila". sonub will not appear in the search results.
