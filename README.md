# Advertisement System
- User-Controlled Advertisement Display
  - Advertisement boxes appear as blank spaces with a help button by default.
  - Users have complete control over whether to enable advertisements.
  - When users choose to enable advertisements:
    - They can select their interests and preferred advertisement categories.
    - Only relevant advertisements matching their selected categories will be displayed.
    - Users can modify their preferences or disable advertisements at any time.
  - This approach respects user privacy and choice while maintaining a non-intrusive experience.
